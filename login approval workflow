## Summary
This PR introduces a new **login approval workflow** for Welo Guard, requiring multi-step verification before granting access to sensitive areas.

## Changes
- Added `approval_workflow.py` module in `src/auth/`
- Implemented `ApprovalManager` class to handle multi-step approvals
- Updated `welo_guard.py` to integrate approval checks in `approve_login()`
- Added new unit tests in `tests/test_approval.py`
